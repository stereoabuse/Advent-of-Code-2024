# Advent of Code 2024

We have to find the [Chief Historian](https://adventofcode.com/2024/day/1) in time!  Currently at 34 stars for 2024.

These solutions are relatively straightforward as one expects for AoC: lots of `re` for parsing, plenty of combinatorial stuff via `itertools`, and `collections` for easier dictionaries and counters. One thing I used more than previous years is `networkx` which is useful in a range of different graph-related problems.

The only slightly unusual approach I used with the currently solved days was testing complex numbers (`1+1j`) as grid locations instead of `[row, column]`. This provided no real benefit beyond making adjacency checks and path traversal require slightly less typing.
